(Bob Andres/Atlanta Journal-Constitution via AP) 'Naked politics' of punishing Delta could haunt Georgia By BEN NADLER and R.J. RICO Mar. 03, 2018 ATLANTA (AP) — Georgia lawmakers' decision to punish Delta Air Lines for publicly distancing itself from the National Rifle Association was an extraordinary act of political revenge. By killing a proposed tax break on jet fuel, pro-gun Republicans won a political victory that could pay off in the short term, but other companies won't soon forget that Georgia allied itself with the NRA over one of its largest private employers, with 33,000 workers statewide. \"When you inject naked politics — and that's what this is — into the economic equation, I think that it does have the chance of spooking the business community,\" said Tom Stringer, a New York-based consultant for the business-advisory firm BDO. \"One thing about the business community is that it has a very long memory.\" The uproar began last Saturday when Delta stopped offering fare discounts to NRA members in the wake of the school massacre in Florida. On Friday, Delta CEO Ed Bastian insisted in a memo to employees that the company was \"not taking sides\" on gun control and made the decision in hopes of removing itself from the gun debate. He said the company's \"values are not for sale\" and \"we are proud and honored to locate our headquarters here.\" Delta recently signed a 20-year lease to keep its hub at Hartsfield-Jackson International Airport in Atlanta, and business consultants said other Atlanta-based firms, such as Coca-Cola and UPS, will likely stay put too. But GOP lawmakers' willingness to use public money to try to intimidate corporations could damage Georgia's ability to attract new industry — including Amazon, which recently named metro Atlanta a finalist for its coveted second headquarters. \"I think it's fair to say that this situation would not be helpful to the state of Georgia in potentially securing the Amazon site,\" said Jerry Funaro, Chicago-based vice president for global marketing at TRC Global Mobility, a relocation management company. \"They could certainly say that this would be a reason to look elsewhere.\" Amazon didn't immediately respond to an email seeking comment. Republican Lt. Gov. Casey Cagle, who is running in a crowded primary for governor in May, set the stage for the fight with Delta with a tweet Monday saying conservatives would fight back. He defended the move Friday. \"We cannot continue to allow large companies to treat conservatives differently than other customers, employees and partners,\" Cagle wrote in an opinion piece published by The Atlanta Journal-Constitution. \"The voters who elected us and believe strongly in our rights and liberties expect and deserve no less.\" Another GOP candidate for governor, Secretary of State Brian Kemp, even suggested using the estimated $38 million the state would save by killing jet fuel tax break to pay for a tax-free \"holiday\" on purchases of guns and ammunition. Other GOP leaders openly cringed at the combative tone Cagle and others took. Republican Gov. Nathan Deal, who is term-limited and serving his final year, bemoaned the controversy as an \"unbecoming squabble\" fueled by election-year posturing. GOP House Speaker David Ralston called it \"not one of our finer days\" when the firestorm erupted Monday. Republicans have controlled the governor's mansion in Georgia since 2003, a deep red streak that makes this year's GOP gubernatorial nominee a likely favorite in November. Deal and other governors for decades have made it a priority to ensure Georgia was an attractive location for prospective employers, said Charles Bullock, a political science professor at the University of Georgia. Before the NRA controversy, he said, many GOP lawmakers defended the jet fuel tax break as necessary to protect jobs. \"What this really does is it says, in terms of setting priorities, that taking a stand on the NRA is more significant,\" Bullock said. \"The jobs thing now is pushed to the back.\" After Delta announced it was cutting ties with the NRA, it took pro-gun Republicans just days to make good on their threats by passing a sweeping tax bill — minus the jet fuel tax break. Deal, who said an estimated $5.2 billion in overall tax savings was too important to sacrifice, swiftly signed the measure into law Friday. He vowed to keep pursuing the jet fuel exemption as a separate issue. Delta revealed Friday that the NRA discount that triggered the showdown had barely been used. Offered recently for NRA members flying to the group's 2018 convention in Dallas, only 13 discounted tickets had been sold, Delta spokesman Trebor Banstetter said. Delta isn't the only company to take action since the Feb. 14 slayings of 17 students and educators in Parkland, Florida, by a gunman armed with an AR-15 assault-style rifle. Walmart, Kroger and Dick's Sporting Goods have tightened their gun sales policies. Meanwhile, MetLife, Hertz and others have joined Delta in ending business ties with the NRA. The extent of the backlash Georgia might face from businesses is unclear. But firms from outside the South may think twice about Georgia if they see a clash of corporate values on guns and other social issues, said Jon Gabrielsen, a business-strategy consultant who worked 17 years in Georgia before moving recently to Mexico. \"If you're not there yet, why would you want to subject yourself to that potential grief with what the legislature just pulled?\" Gabrielsen said. ___ AP reporter Russ Bynum in Savannah, Georgia, and Airlines Writer David Koenig in Dallas contributed to this story.\n",

      "Scot Peterson opens the door to his work vehicle late last year. He returned his car and his badge to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office when he retired eight days after the massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla. (Courtesy of Scot Peterson) BOYNTON BEACH, Fla. — Scot Peterson had spent much of the past three months in hiding, but now somebody was walking onto his porch and toward the front door. A motion detector activated an alarm inside his duplex. Peterson, 55, ducked away from the windows and bent out of sight. His girlfriend, Lydia Rodriguez, walked to the entryway and began to pull down a corner of the white sheet that now covered most of their front door. “Oh, please,” she said. “What now?” It had been exactly 90 days since Peterson’s last shift as a school resource officer in Parkland, Fla., where he had been armed and on duty as 17 people were killed and 17 more were injured, and ever since then a procession had been making its way to his door to demand accountability for another American mass shooting. First came the Broward County Sheriff’s Office to repossess his police cruiser and his badge. Then came dozens of reporters and television trucks, jamming into the cul-de-sac of a retirement community to broadcast stories about the “Coward of Broward.” Then came a court officer serving Peterson with a lawsuit from a parent whose daughter had been fatally shot on the school’s third floor. “Scot Peterson is a coward,” it read. “Scot Peterson did nothing. Scot Peterson waited and listened to the din of screams of teachers and students, many of who were dead and dying. He let innocent people die.” “I’m not here,” Peterson said now to Rodriguez as she looked out beyond the sheet and sunlight streamed into their living room. “It’s okay,” she said, waving at two octogenarians holding a bag of cookies on the porch. “It’s the neighbors. Jim and Kelly.” Peterson invited them inside and offered them seats in the living room. Christian music played over the speakers and Fox News Channel was muted on television. “Thank God for you two,” Peterson told them. They were two of the only people who had come over after the shooting just to ask if he was okay. As the crowds grew outside his house, they had let him sneak out his back door and through their yard whenever he left to see his lawyer, visit a psychologist, or go for a drive when he couldn’t sleep. “How are you managing?” Kelly asked. “I have some okay moments,” he said. “We’ve been worried,” Jim said. “We’ve been watching the news.” “Oh yeah? What are they saying?” Peterson asked, even though he had already heard what they were saying and couldn’t stop himself from hearing it, even now. “A disgrace,” the sheriff had said during a news conference. “An awful human being,” one survivor said on national television. “A blight on law enforcement,” said a police union. “A coward,” said President Trump. “When it came time to get in there and do something, he didn’t have the courage.” Their words ran in a loop through his head, because all this time Peterson had been wondering, too: What more could he possibly have done? Why had he failed to save so many lives in the exact scenario he had spent so much of his career training for — to find and kill an active shooter? He had worked as a sheriff’s deputy for 32 years, as a school resource officer for 28, and at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for nearly a decade. He was the lone deputy stationed at the school, sworn to serve and protect a community of students who called him “Dep,” honored him with awards, and invited him to proms and football games. He had been admired and maybe even beloved up until a former student named Nikolas Cruz allegedly arrived at school with an AR-15. And ever since, Peterson had been living inside those next seven minutes. He had briefly considered changing his name or moving out of state, but even if he could somehow outrun infamy and embarrassment, he had decided there was no escape from the questions and doubts that consumed him. Peterson had worked at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for almost 10 years. Twice he had confiscated knives on campus. He had never once found a gun at school before the massacre. (Courtesy of Scot Peterson) “It’s haunting,” Peterson said now. “I’ve cut that day up a thousand ways with a million different what-if scenarios, but the bottom line is I was there to protect, and I lost 17.” “Come on, now,” Jim said. “It’s not all on you.” “But that’s the perception,” Peterson said. “You’re a hero or a coward, and that’s it.” “People are looking for someone to point to and blame,” Jim said. “They’re just trying to make sense of it.” “I know,” Peterson said. “So am I.” *** It was in some ways the simplest kind of crime to solve: committed by one perpetrator who had surrendered and then confessed within an hour. And yet, months later half a dozen inquiries remained underway, each an attempt to derive sense and order from seven chaotic minutes. The FBI was reviewing its threat response. A governor’s commission was examining school security failures. The sheriff’s office was looking into radio malfunctions. The Florida Department of Law Enforcement was investigating the sheriff’s office. Peterson had been doing his own investigating, too, studying dozens of pages of documents inside his duplex. He had rewatched surveillance footage and read witness statements, searching for a way to reconcile the deputy he believed he was with the coward who was maligned each day in the national news. “How can they keep saying I did nothing?” he asked Rodriguez one morning, looking again through the documents on his kitchen table. “I’m getting on the radio to call in the shooting. I’m locking down the school. I’m clearing kids out of the courtyard. They have the video and the call logs. The evidence is sitting right there.” “It’s easy to second-guess when you’re in some conference room, spending months thinking about what you would have done,” Rodriguez said. “There wasn’t even time to think,” Peterson said. “It just happened, and I started reacting.” He remembered being in his office on the afternoon of Feb. 14 when the first call came in to his school radio, as he was waiting to meet with a parent about a student’s fake driver’s license. On most days, that was his job: to police the small stuff — to chase down stolen cellphones, confiscate marijuana, lecture students for vaping in class, and break up the occasional hallway fight. Twice he had caught students with knives, but not once in the past decade had he encountered a gun. Stoneman Douglas was a high-achieving suburban school, with Audis in the student parking lot and packed PTA meetings each month. The school employed eight security guards to help monitor 13 buildings spread across 45 acres, but Peterson was the only person who carried a gun. “If I have to arrest you, then something has gone wrong,” Peterson often told students, because his role was less to be an enforcer of the law than a friendly reminder of it. He had worked before as a corrections guard and as a road officer arriving at the scenes of fatal car crashes and homicides, but it was his work as a school resource officer that had made him one of the most decorated deputies in Parkland. “Possible firecracker,” came the call in to his school radio at 2:21 p.m., from one of the school’s eight full-time security guards. “Firecracker over by the 1200 building.” Peterson had dealt with fireworks on campus before, and if there were ever a likely time for one, it was now, during the last class period on Valentine’s Day. “Probably a few kids acting like idiots,” Peterson remembered thinking, and he stood from his desk and walked out to investigate. His office was a few hundred yards from the 1200 building, and he was heading in that direction with a security guard when a fire alarm went off. Smoke from the firecracker had probably triggered the alarm, Peterson remembered thinking. He began running toward the 1200 building until one of the unarmed security guards swung by in a golf cart and offered him a ride. Peterson climbed onto the back and jumped off the cart about 20 yards from the 1200 building. The security guard drove away, and Peterson took a few steps toward the building before he heard two loud bangs. They didn’t sound like firecrackers. Maybe gunshots, he thought. He remembered being unsure whether the blasts were coming from outside or inside the building, or if someone was firing shots in the adjacent parking lot or sniping from the roof. He didn’t know, and no one was there to tell him, and he remembered reacting in those first seconds by doing what he believed he had been trained to do: taking cover in a tactical position so he could clear the area. He leaned his back against the wall of an adjacent building. He took out his gun and scanned the surrounding palm trees, the courtyard, the windows, the parking lot and the roof. He waved at students who were walking through the courtyard and told them to clear the area. He reached for his school radio and gave a “Code Red” to lock down the school. He picked up his police radio for the first time just after 2:23 p.m. “Please advise, we have possible, uh, could be firecrackers. I think we got shots fired. Possible shots fired, 1200 building,” he said, according to a recording of the radio traffic. He remembered standing for the next several seconds with his back against the wall, scanning the area around the building for a possible shooter. Trees. Roof. Windows. Courtyard. Trees, roof, windows, courtyard. He could see much of campus from his position, but he couldn’t find a shooter. He remembered staying in place because he didn’t want to expose himself when he didn’t know where the shots were coming from. He remembered feeling certain the gunshots were coming from somewhere near or inside the 1200 building, but where? “Make sure we get some units over here,” he said into the radio, still at 2:23 p.m. “I need to shut down Stoneman Douglas, the intersection.” “We’re talking about the 1200 building,” he said, a few seconds later. “We don’t have any description yet,” he said, at 2:24. “We just hear shots, what appear to be shots fired.” How often had he envisioned this moment? How much time had he spent studying other mass shootings, imagining himself on scene, wondering how he would react? He had gone to annual conferences about school shootings, taken a class on confronting active shooters and led annual lockdown training for teachers. He had started his career as a school resource officer years before the 1999 shooting at Columbine High School in Colorado, back when the idea of a school shooting seemed far-fetched, but now it was a possibility he carried in his mind as he walked around campus each day. There were always a few students the administration worried about, and three years earlier one had been caught with written plans for how to shoot up the school. Peterson had imagined what he would do if someone started firing in the crowded courtyard during lunch or at halftime of a football game. The ending he imagined was always the same: He identified the shooter. He engaged the shooter. He killed the shooter. But now he stood against the wall, holding his radio in one hand and his gun in the other. He remembered wondering why he could not locate the shots. Trees, roof, windows, courtyard. The fire alarm was still blaring. Police sirens were closing in from all directions. From Peterson’s position, he could see only the east side entrance to the 1200 building. Meanwhile, on the west side, at least one victim was already down. Students inside the 1200 building were at that very moment flooding 911 with calls describing the exact location and description of the shooter, but it turned out that those calls were being routed not to the Broward County Sheriff’s Office but instead to the bordering Coral Springs Police Department. Coral Springs officers were not yet on the scene, and even once they arrived, they communicated on a separate radio system from Peterson and the rest of Broward County. The only information being relayed to him was coming out of his Broward County radio, a soundtrack first of silence and then of mounting confusion as the shooting continued into its fourth minute. “I hear shots fired by the football field!” shouted the second Broward County deputy to arrive. “Shots by the football field.” “Some thought it was firecrackers. We’re not sure,” said the next deputy on site. “By the football field.” “We also heard it over by, inside the 1200 building,” Peterson said, still standing in place. “We are locking down the school right now.” “I got more students running west toward the football field,” another officer said. “I hear shots fired,” Peterson said. “Shots — ” “I have a gunshot victim,” said another deputy. “He is by the entrance to West Glades, on the west side of the school.” “Does he know where the shooter is?” Peterson shouted, but now it was already six minutes into the massacre, and the last victim had already been shot on the third floor. The gunman was dropping his AR-15 near the stairwell and then heading out of the building, blending in with the crowd of frantic students. The shooting Peterson was supposed to stop was already over. A Coral Springs SWAT team arrived almost five minutes later to clear the building, and Peterson left his position against the wall and ran to give the team his set of master keys to the classroom doors. He passed by the entrance of the 1200 building for the first time, and there in the hall he could see two victims. He still didn’t know whether there were more. He still didn’t know anything about the identity or the location of the shooter. He stayed on the scene for the next several hours, helping to move bodies as the death toll mounted, and later that night he went home to Rodriguez. She had been sure he was dead the moment she heard the report of “one victim” on the television news. They had talked dozens of times about how he would be the first person through the door to confront a shooter. But instead, here he was, stammering over his words, the grief and self-doubt already beginning as he tried to make sense of why 17 people were dead and 17 were injured and the only dirt on his uniform was from where his back had been pressed against the wall. “I couldn’t get him,” he remembered telling Rodriguez that day, before anyone else had begun to assign blame. “It was my job, and I didn’t find him.” *** In his sleep, he was still looking, still scanning the roof, windows and courtyard, only to awaken each morning to the fresh realization of the same result. He had gone to see a psychologist and a psychiatrist after the shooting, and he had come home with a prescription to help him sleep and a sheet describing the symptoms he had begun to experience: “Confusion.” “Anxiety.” “Guilt.” “Grief.” “Agitation.” “Obsession.” “Why didn’t I hear more shots?” he said one morning, sifting again through the manila folder as Rodriguez sat nearby. “It doesn’t make sense. I should have heard them, but I didn’t.” “Relax,” she said, putting her hand on his. “I only remember hearing two or three,” he said. “I know there were more, but that’s all I heard.” “Let it be,” she said, even though she knew that wasn’t possible, because she had heard Peterson turn each detail of the shooting into a self-interrogation, a cycle of blame and abdication that could sometimes last all day. Maybe he hadn’t heard more shots because of the fire alarm, or because of his positioning in the courtyard, or because the thick hurricane windows in the 1200 building muffled the sound of gunfire. Or maybe it was the explanation his psychologist had offered, about the ways a traumatic experience could affect cognitive function, compressing memories, narrowing focus, clouding vision and distorting sound. “If I heard more shots, I might have known where to find him,” Peterson said. “If I knew where he was, I could have gone in.” “If I’d gone in . . .” he continued, and Rodriguez squeezed his shoulder before he could finish the thought. “Let’s get some air,” she said. She moved the sheet and looked outside to make sure nobody was there. Then they leashed the dog and walked out into a retirement development of cul-de-sacs, palm trees and rows of identical duplexes. Rodriguez had just retired from teaching, and lately she considered it her job to support Peterson and keep him from “sinking too deep down inside his own head,” she said. He hadn’t eaten or slept for two days after the shooting, sick with what he assumed was survivor’s guilt, even though nobody else had begun to publicly question his response. In those first days, the sheriff’s office had invited him to shake Trump’s hand and be congratulated along with other first responders, but Peterson had chosen to stay home. “Nothing good happened that day,” he remembered telling his supervisor. He gave his official statement to homicide investigators two days after the massacre, attended two funerals, and used sick days to finish out the first week. He was just preparing to return to work when he got a call from internal affairs eight days after the shooting. The sheriff’s office had reviewed surveillance tapes and watched as Peterson stood against the wall. Sheriff Scott Israel offered him two choices: He could be suspended indefinitely without pay, or he could retire with his full pension, an annual payment of nearly $100,000. Peterson had little money saved, two ex-wives, alimony payments and a mortgage on the duplex he had bought out of foreclosure with $100 down. He didn’t see it as a choice. He signed his retirement papers, and about an hour later the sheriff called a news conference to release more details about the shooting. The country was demanding an explanation, and for the first time he gave them something or someone to blame. Rodriguez had tried to cushion all that came next with positivity — with Christian music, prayer and aphorisms framed in every corner of the house. “Rule your mind, or it will rule you,” read one. “Cherish Yourself!” “Create Your Own Happiness!” She had disconnected their TV, booked vacations in the mountains of North Carolina and covertly texted his old friends from the sheriff’s office, nudging them to reach out and call. But on some days, Peterson still seemed unreachable, including now, back on his tablet as he scanned recent headlines. “Where are you? Come back,” Rodriguez said, but Peterson didn’t seem to hear her. He looked at the tablet, where a little while later he saw a new headline, a breaking news alert. “School shooting in Texas,” it read. “Several dead.” “Dear God. Not again,” he said, and he turned off the Christian music and flipped on the television in time to see an aerial view of Santa Fe High School surrounded by helicopters, ambulances and police cars. Frantic students ran in every direction. A confused parent stammered through an interview. “My daughter. Where’s my daughter?” she said. “I really shouldn’t watch this,” Peterson said, his voice beginning to crack, but he kept his eyes on the screen. He watched them load the ambulances. He watched a SWAT team enter the school. He watched as the sheriff held his first news conference, promising “accountability and answers.” He watched as a somber news anchor came on screen to confirm 10 dead and several more wounded, including a school resource officer in critical condition. “Unlike in Parkland, this time the deputy went in,” the anchor said, and Peterson braced to hear his name. “A case study in the difference between heroism and cowardice,” the anchor said, and now Peterson was shrinking deeper into the couch and into his head. He had read that the gunman fired more than 150 rounds. Why had he heard only two or three? “We all remember how in that case the deputy just waited outside, knowing full well . . . ” the anchor began to say, but before he could finish, Peterson reached for the remote and turned it off. *** It was true that he had never gone into the 1200 building that day, neither during the shooting nor after, and now the closest he could come was by watching a video he had found while looking for information about the shooting on his computer. It was a schematic animation of the crime scene that investigators had made using surveillance footage from 15 cameras in the school. “A little like Pac-Man,” was how one investigator had described the animation, because the 1200 building had been turned into a 3-D architectural sketch, the gunman was represented by a roving black rifle, and the students had become colored dots. It was a version of a mass shooting with no gunfire, no blood, no screaming, no shattering glass and no hallways obscured by smoke. Here, the chaos had been rendered into something silent and orderly, time-stamped to the one-hundredth of a second. Peterson enlarged the video on his screen and hit play. “As people are injured, their green dots will become yellow,” the narrator said. “Fatalities will turn gray.” “Oh, not the dots,” Rodriguez called out from the kitchen, because she had watched the video with Peterson once and thought that was probably enough. “It helps me if I can see it,” he said. “It clears up my thinking.” So Peterson watched as the black rifle that represented Cruz entered the building on the first floor at 2:21:23 p.m., and he watched seven seconds later as the first two dots turned gray in the main corridor. Within 20 seconds, two more students were dead and four more were injured. Within 80 seconds, a total of eight were dead and 11 injured. “That first burst of gunfire is probably what triggered the firecracker call on the school radio and then the fire alarm,” Peterson said as he watched dots scatter across the scene. “I’m still running out of my office. I haven’t even gotten over there. What am I supposed to do?” He watched as the black rifle stopped at four classrooms on the first floor, shooting through doors and windows, circling back to fire more rounds at injured victims as dots turned from green to yellow to gray. A green dot entered the hall from outside and came into the corridor, moving purposefully toward the shooter. “Oh, God. That’s Chris,” Peterson said, meaning his friend Chris Hixon, one of the school’s security guards who had run into the building despite being unarmed. Peterson wondered whether Hixon, who also was the school’s athletic director, had gone in expecting to find a few kids with firecrackers, or whether he had somehow figured out a shooting was underway. “Was he trying to stop it? Was he hoping to tackle him?” Peterson said, but now he watched as the black rifle turned in Hixon’s direction, and his dot turned yellow as he was hit for the first time. The yellow dot raced behind a wall for cover. The black gun moved closer, taking its time, until it and the yellow dot were side by side. “A damn monster,” Peterson said, backing away from the screen as Hixon’s dot went from yellow to gray. Eleven dead and 13 injured in less than two minutes. The black rifle began moving up the stairs toward the second floor at 2:23:28, about the same time Peterson called in to the police radio to report possible fireworks or gunshots at the school. “Now I’m finally getting near there,” Peterson said, as he watched the black rifle move methodically through the second floor, finding no victims but firing rounds that traveled through doors and then out windows. “I was trying to figure it out,” Peterson said again. “I was scanning for the shooter, looking over the windows, the sidewalk, the rooftop. I thought maybe it was a sniper like in Las Vegas. I just didn’t know.” Peterson watched on screen as the black rifle continued unabated up the stairs to the third floor, arriving on the landing at 2:24:30. The hall was crowded with students evacuating because of the fire alarm. Some would later tell investigators that they didn’t realize an active shooter was in the building. Like Peterson, they had not been able to hear or place the gunshots that were coming from the first floor. Dozens of them sprinted for the stairs as the gunman opened fire, reloading as he traveled up and down the hall, killing six more students and injuring four before he shot his last victim at 2:25:19. “I was right outside,” Peterson said, pausing the video, rewinding it, sitting again through those 49 seconds when he was standing against a wall and the gunman was shooting on the third floor. On the screen, the shooting appeared clear and the tactical response seemed obvious. Peterson traced his finger over the stairs. “I could have come in over here,” he said. “I could have got him while he was reloading. If I’d just heard more shots, maybe I would have known where they were coming from.” Maybe then, he said, 49 seconds would have been enough to do something. Maybe, he said, he would have left the wall and sprinted into the building. Maybe, he said, he would have known to run directly to the third floor, rather than clearing the first two floors. Maybe, he said, he would have located the shooter through the dust and smoke and fleeing students. Maybe, he said, he would have harnessed 20 years of training and steadied his gun on the target. Maybe, he said, his Glock would have proved enough to outgun an AR-15. “It was all so fast,” he said. “I couldn’t piece it all together.” “Stop torturing yourself,” Rodriguez said. “It’s brutal,” he said, but he watched until the last dot turned gray and the black rifle moved down the stairs and out of the school. *** He didn’t want to answer his phone. He didn’t want to take the sheet off the front door, leave the house or risk being seen, so instead he was back on his tablet one morning when a message arrived from another former school resource officer in Parkland, offering a time to meet for breakfast. “Go,” Rodriguez told Peterson, so he chose a diner in Boca Raton where no one would recognize him. He drove 30 minutes and then sat down in a booth across from Frank Wear. “Convenient spot,” Wear teased. “I can’t go back into Broward,” Peterson said. “I don’t want to run into anyone. I just — I don’t even know what I would say.” “No, I get it,” Wear said, because they had been friends for more than a decade. They had gone together to active-shooter training and taken a motorcycle trip to celebrate Wear’s retirement in 2017. Wear knew Peterson as a good cop, thorough and fair. “He had a pulse on everything happening over at Douglas,” Wear said, and that had also included Nikolas Cruz. Peterson had met with Cruz in the fall of 2016 and warned him against carrying a backpack decorated with Nazi insignia and racial slurs. He had requested a mental health evaluation after a classmate said that Cruz allegedly drank gasoline. He had even suggested that counselors use Florida’s Baker Act to have Cruz involuntarily committed, but a health expert wrote that Cruz “did not meet criteria for further assessment.” So instead Cruz had left school, and Peterson had gone back to dealing with a dozen other troubled students until a year later, when Cruz suddenly returned. “The thing I keep coming back to is all those shots,” Peterson said now. “I heard two or three. It’s like my focus narrowed and maybe parts got cloudy.” “I’ve been there,” Wear said, and he began to tell the story of a time when he had been the first officer to arrive at a scene, back in 2001. He had caught two men in the middle of an armed robbery in Deerfield Beach and chased them through the neighborhood by car, eventually ramming his cruiser into their vehicle. The men wore “Scream” masks and carried a revolver and a semiautomatic pistol, and one fired at Wear as he took cover and shot back. He remembered his heart beating in his ears. He remembered the hazy feeling of time passing in slow motion as he killed one assailant and then helped apprehend the other. “Talk about performing under pressure,” Peterson said. “Your life was on the line.” “I just reacted,” Wear said. “Still,” Peterson said. “It was heroic.” “I feel stupid talking about this,” Wear said. He shifted in his seat and looked down at his coffee. On a television in the far corner of the restaurant, the news replayed images from the school shooting in Texas. An ambulance raced onto the school track. A team of police officers rushed into the building. Peterson sat in silence for a few seconds and moved the eggs around on his plate. “Look, you were one guy, and you had communications failures, no information, just chaos,” Wear said. “We’re not all Rambo.” “They keep saying I did nothing,” Peterson said. “A coward.” And now he was retreating back into his head, returning again to the wall outside the 1200 building as his food went cold and the wait staff switched over from breakfast to lunch. “I was looking for him,” he said, scanning again over the courtyard, the windows and the rooftop in his mind, trying and failing to make sense of another mass shooting.

      "1st Day Of School At Marjory Stoneman Douglas High, 6 Months After Mass Shooting Students arrive Wednesday for their first day back at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, six months after the fatal shootings of Feb. 14. As students arrived at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School for the start of the new school year on Wednesday, they found a tall new fence surrounding the perimeter, banners draped along the exterior willing them to be \"#MSDStrong,\" and a fresh coat of burgundy paint in the hallways. Each in its own way was an attempt to mark the setting as a place of learning and reassure its occupants of a fortified safety within its walls. At a news conference held on the school lawn, Broward County Public Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie called it a \"bittersweet day.\" \"Everyone's glad to get back and be reunited,\" Runcie said, six months and one day after the deadly shooting at the Parkland, Fla., high school. \"But it's six months away from the tragedy, which feels like it happened just yesterday.\" Students cross the street, headed for Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Wednesday. (Getty Images) A former student carried out a mass shooting on Feb. 14, killing 17 students and teachers. \"A lot of emotions going on,\" Runcie continued Wednesday. \"It's still a challenging time for many of the students and faculty.\" Sara Cardona, a junior, said it was difficult to be back on campus. \"It's going to feel weird to not see some kids in our classes that we're used to seeing,\" Cardona said. It was easier to put both the violence of the rampage and the death of 17 classmates out of her mind over the vacation months \"because I feel like during summer, you don't really see anybody so it's like OK.\" But being back on campus — near the same classrooms where terrified children hid behind doors and inside closets — is likely to bring back frightening memories for some returning students. Still, Cardona expressed optimism about the year ahead. \"I feel like a lot of people are hopeful and excited for the new year. And I feel like it's going to be OK,\" she said. Since the end of the last academic year and throughout the summer Broward County Public Schools — the second-largest district in Florida with more than 200 schools — has taken steps to make all of its schools safer. Armed security staff have been assigned to each of its campuses. \"We are moving forward and accelerated our single point of entry projects which uses a system of gates, fencing to funnel all visitors to a single point,\" he added. The district is also moving forward with the state-mandated Coach Aaron Feis School Guardian Program, which allows certain school employees to carry guns on campus. And across the district, campuses will be running a \"code red drill\" during the first two weeks of school, and one each month thereafter. A Broward County Sheriff officer checks the IDs of people arriving at the school on Wednesday. (Getty Images) At Marjory Stoneman Douglas, automatically locking doors have been installed. Instead of one school resource officer there are now at least three armed guards on campus, plus 15 other security monitors. Plans to add metal detectors have been halted amid concerns over privacy and the logistics of having 3,000 students walk through them every day. Incoming ninth-grade students will never set foot in the freshman building where the devastating shooting took place. That three-story structure will eventually be torn down. For now, it remains sealed up for evidentiary purposes under order from the State Attorney's Office. To students and their parents it is reminder of the shooting, surrounded by a 12-foot fence. The state has set aside $25 million for a replacement, until then students will attend classes in 34 portable classrooms. But no combination of building upgrades and boost in police presence has been enough to assuage some parents' anxiety over the perils of gun violence their children face in and out of school. \"They've stepped up security and there are measures in place now to hopefully stop it a little bit. But it could have been at a mall, it could have been anywhere,\" said Andy Libert, who drove his son Ryan to school Wednesday morning. \"The bottom line is a kid fell through the cracks in the system and he needed help,\" he added. Fred Guttenberg, whose daughter Jaime was killed in the massacre, marked the first day of school on Twitter, sharing his son Jesse's decision to return to the same school as a senior. \"First day of school is not supposed to feel this way. Jaime was always most excited and I am missing her excitement today,\" Guttenberg wrote.\"I am so proud of @JesseGuttenberg. This year he will park in the senior lot and will have to walk by the building where Jaime was murdered 2 times per day,\" he ended. Runcie announced the district is increasing the number of mental health counselors and behavior specialists and is upgrading its risk assessment teams, who will be charged with identifying students with \"challenges.\" \"We've got to make sure we're doing the right kind of interventions, that the right kind of supports are there,\" Runcie explained. Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie (center) greets students as they arrive. (Getty Images) It's not just the schools that have changed since the shooting. Many of the students at Marjory Stoneman Douglas have now become activists, pushing for gun control and other measures they believe will make schools safer. \"This whole summer I've been joking with my friends while we're on the bus, there's three years until I can take a government class. But I'm lobbying in D.C.,\" she said. Hogg said with all of the district's ramped up security measures, she is not worried about safety at her school. But she said it doesn't begin to address the problem of gun violence. \"What they did at my school is in a way, putting a Band-Aid on a broken bone,\" she said, exasperated. \"Sure, it will fix this, but how's it going to protect my friends go to concerts, who go to clubs, who go to movie theaters, who go anywhere else and are in danger, even some of them just getting to school in inner cities?\" she asked.\n",

      "Students walk out of class as part of national protest They were dressed in black to mourn the victims of the Parkland, Florida, high school shooting as they protested gun violence with their teachers Wednesday morning. The students at Madison Senior High School joined those across the U.S. who left their classrooms at 10 a.m. for the National School Walkout protest. The demonstrations came one month after the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. Walkouts were scheduled to last for 17 minutes, one minute for each of the 17 people who died in the school shooting. Damien James, 16, said he wanted to participate in Madison to honor them. Be the first to know. No one covers what is happening in our community better than we do. And with a digital subscription, you'll never miss a local story. “I feel like it’s right because if I was in their situation, I would want somebody to walk for me, too,” he said. “Like, at least do something for me.” He and his classmates marched up 6th Street near the school holding signs that read “Never again.” Jahanna Gillespie, Anthony Walker Jr., and Rhyheem Samuels hold signs with #Never Again as they march with other students from Madison Junior/Senior High School. The students held an organized walkout march through the neighborhood by their school. Derik Holtmann dholtmann@bnd.com Social studies teacher Reneesha Sanders said she marched with students “because we don’t want this to happen in our schools. We don’t want this to happen ever again in any schools.” Damien and Darria Miller, another 16-year-old from Madison, said they’ve talked to their friends about school shootings. “We talk about what we’re going to do if a school shooter comes in or if anybody comes in that’s not welcome,” Darria said. BND Reporter Kaley Johnson talked to students during a 17-minute walkout protest at Madison Junior/Senior High on March 14. The national protest saw students across the country walk out of class to protest gun violence and school safety. This was By Damien’s friends decided they would use windows to escape and run, he said. “When we hear stuff about it, we talk about it,” Damien said. Thalia Johnson, a high school student in O’Fallon, said she would make two phone calls: one to her parents and one to her brother, who is also a student, “to see if he is OK and safe.” At O’Fallon Township High School, like several other schools in the metro-east, students faced punishment if they walked out of their classrooms Wednesday as part of the national protest. In a letter to parents, O’Fallon District 203 Superintendent Darcy Benway said it would be considered skipping. Despite warnings of disciplinary action from O’Fallon Township High School District 203 administration, roughly 50 students still walked out of classes for 17 minutes at 10 a.m. as part of a national protest. By “OTHS District 203 supports a student’s Constitutional right to protest and to engage in peaceful assembly,” Benway wrote. “However, a school walkout-protest is an act of civil disobedience and, by definition, a violation of rules.” For about 50 students who participated anyway, O’Fallon Township High School junior Jordain Carpenter said, “the message we are trying to send is more important than any discipline the school is going to give to us.” “It’s to send a message that as a nation, as students, we are not going to let these shootings go by like another day,” Jordain added. In Highland, students could participate with permission from their parents. About 28 high school students gathered to pay tribute to the Parkland victims. Three middle school students joined them. Twenty-eight Highland High School students and three Highland Middle School students walked out of class Wednesday morning in Highland. The event was part of the National School Walkout protest against gun violence. The attending middle schoolers By No media or non-school personnel were allowed on school grounds during the Highland demonstration, other than the parents of the three Highland Middle School students, who walked their children across the street to the high school. The middle school students brought a sign with them made from a bed sheet. Spray-painted in blue and gold, it read “Protecting kids is not political” in response to administrators’ request that students not bring political signs to school Wednesday. “We come from a community where everybody knows everybody; it’s really small and we think that we are somehow untouchable,” said Joanna Fogg, one of the Highland Middle School students. “But we need to get it out there that this kind of stuff can happen to any community. We need to put a stop to it.” Three Highland Middle School students, escorted by their parents, walked across the street to participate in the walkout at Highland High School on Wednesday morning. Pictured from left: seventh-grader Joanna Fogg, seventh-grader Grace Powers, and sixth-grader Hillary McLaughlin. They made a sign that read \"Protecting Kids is Not Political.\" Curt Libbra clibbra@bnd.com While students demonstrated outside, Highland High School Principal Karen Gauen said about 30-40 students gathered inside the high school to talk with a Highland police officer about school safety. As a sort of counter-protest, several high school students wore camouflage to school Wednesday. But Gauen said they were respectful to each other. At Belleville West High School, students organized a walkout through Twitter and flyers they handed out at lunch. Skylr Koehler, a senior and one of the walkout organizers, said they wanted to have an event at West where students could talk about school safety and remember the Parkland victims “because it is a really hard time for teenagers.” Since the 2017 shooting at a music festival in Las Vegas and the Feb. 14 shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Skylr said she has become more “emotionally attached to the problem.” At least 100 students walked out of school at Belleville West, according to organizers Kierney Burks and Cori White. A half dozen police vehicles were seen in the front and back parking lots at Belleville East High School, where students participated in the walkout in a safe location, according to Principal Jason Karstens. Althoff Catholic High School students got involved through a memorial mass for the Parkland victims Wednesday. More than 100 students from East St. Louis Senior High School walked out of their classrooms to call for gun safety in schools and communities, East St. Louis District 189 spokesperson Sydney Stigge-Kaufman said. About 25 students from the Younge Alternative Center also walked out of the school. Behind the protest Students planned the events that took place at their schools Wednesday, in many cases working with their administrators. But the group that called for the nationwide demonstrations is Women’s March Youth EMPOWER. It is hoping the walkouts will influence lawmakers to pass gun control legislation. These are the changes the group is asking for: Banning assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. Expanding background checks to all gun sales. Passing legislation establishing gun violence restraining orders. Passing the Stop Militarizing Law Enforcement Act. Stopping legislation establishing conceal carry reciprocity. Stopping legislation to add more guns to protect schools against attack, including proposals to arm teachers. In Illinois, Gov. Bruce Rauner vetoed a bill related to guns sales the day before the National School Walkout protests. Students and faculty at Madison Senior High School held an organized walkout march through the neighborhood near their school on March 14, 2018. Derik Holtmann dholtmann@bnd.com The legislation would have required gun retailers to be licensed by the state, to undergo training and to begin videotaping some areas of their businesses, including where guns are stored. It passed in the Democratic-controlled General Assembly in response to the school shooting in Parkland and to address gun violence in Chicago. The Republican governor said the bill would have hurt small business owners and wouldn’t have made communities safer. A small group of Illinois legislators, including Sen. James Clayborne, D-Belleville, walked out of the state capitol Wednesday in support of the student protests.\n",

      "All but three of the victims were students with ages ranging from 14 to 18 years old. COACH AND SECURITY MONITORAssistant football coach Aaron Feis was shot to death while selflessly shielding students from bullets. A tweet from the school football program ended: \"He died a hero and he will forever be in our hearts and memories.\" Feis graduated from the school in 1999 and worked mainly with the junior varsity, the team website said. It said he lived in nearby Coral Springs with his wife and daughter. The team website said Feis spent his entire coaching career at Marjory Stoneman after playing there as a student. The Sun Sentinel reported that Feis, acting as a school security guard, responded to the original call on a school walkie-talkie. Someone on the radio asked if loud sounds they heard were firecrackers, said football coach Willis May, who also carries a radio. ATHLETIC DIRECTOR 'WAS JUST AMAZING'A married father of two and the athletic director at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, Chris Hixon wasn't shy about jumping in wherever he was needed, said friend and one-time colleague Dianne Sanzari. Hixon belonged to a Roman Catholic church in Hollywood. The Archdiocese of Miami confirmed his death Thursday. When a volleyball team needed a fill-in coach, Hixon took over; the same thing happened with the wrestling team, Sanzari said. And when the school needed someone to patrol the campus and monitor threats as a security specialist, Hixon did that, too. It was in that security role that Hixon apparently came within range of the shooter. 'AN ANGEL TAKEN AWAY FROM US'Meadow Pollack's parents called her phone repeatedly only to hear it ring, as they kept an anxious vigil outside the hospital. But on Thursday, her father, Andrew Pollack, confirmed that his daughter was among the dead, the Palm Beach Post reported. Eighteen-year-old Pollack, a senior, had planned to attend Lynn University, her father said. The club posted a note it said was from her family which read: \"To Alyssa's Friends honor Alyssa by doing something fabulous in your life. Don't ever give up and inspire for greatness. Live for Alyssa! Be her voice and breathe for her. Alyssa loved you all forever!\" Youkilis called for gun-control legislation, saying Jaime's parents were \"the world's most loving and over-protective parents but they could not protect Jaime from the sickness that has gripped our country.\" Trump Decries ‘Terrible Violence’ in Fla. School Shooting In an address to the nation, President Donald Trump offered his condolences to the victims of the deadly school shooting in Parkland, Florida. BALLOONS FOR THE VICTIMSShooting victim Martin Duque was one of Isaac Briones' best friends. \"He was like, one of the nicest people I knew,\" said Briones, 15. \"He was so caring.\" Briones said he last saw Martin the day of the shooting during first period. \"We were just playing around, talking about jokes and stuff,\" said Isaac, who was outside the school Thursday with others holding a group of white balloons for the victims. On Instagram, Miguel Duque wrote that words can't describe the pain of losing his brother. He added: \"I love brother Martin you'll be missed buddy. I know you're in a better place.

      "The victims of the Douglas High mass shooting Azra, left, and Unser Khan of Parkland grieve outside of Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Thursday, Feb. 15, 2018. The family's adult children are both graduates of the school. (Joe Cavaretta/Sun Sentinel/TNS) The Broward County Sheriff’s Office released the names of the 17 people killed Wednesday in the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. Relatives and friends of the victims took to social media Thursday to mourn and honor the people they lost. The victims were: — Alyssa Alhadeff, 14 Alyssa, a freshman, had been reported missing by her grandmother Wednesday after the shooting. Her cousin Ariella Del Quaglio confirmed the student’s death via Facebook on Thursday. — Scott Beigel, 35 Beigel was a geography teacher and a cross country coach at the school who unlocked his classroom to allow panicked students to take shelter inside during the shooting. He was struck and killed by a bullet while closing the door behind them. Kelsey Friend, one of the students whose lives he saved, told CNN, “When he opened the door, he had to relock it so that we could stay safe, but he didn’t get the chance.” Directly addressing Beigel’s family, Friend said, “Thank you for bringing and having this amazing person in life and giving him the power to be stronger than I could have ever been.” Thomas Risley, 15, said he had been in Beigel’s world history class earlier in the day. They were doing assessments and talking about the Glorious Revolution. Risley said he can’t believe his teacher is gone. “He cared a lot about his students,” he said. “It’s going to be really sad walking into that classroom and not seeing him. I’m going to miss his colorful personality.” — Martin Duque, 14 Martin, a freshman, was at school Wednesday and died in the shooting. His older brother Miguel, who graduated from Stoneman Douglas High last year, shared the news via an Instagram post early Thursday morning. “Words can not describe my pain,” he wrote. “I love brother Martin you’ll be missed buddy.” — Nicholas Dworet, 17 Nicholas, a senior who had just received a swimming scholarship to the University of Indianapolis, was killed. Glenn Greenwald, a journalist with The Intercept, shared the news on Twitter. — Aaron Feis, 37 Feis, an assistant football coach, was critically injured after jumping in front of the shooter to protect students. He died from his wounds Wednesday night. The school’s football team announced the news on its Twitter account. — Jaime Guttenberg, 14 Jamie, a student at the school, was killed during the rampage. Her father, Fred, shared the tragic news in a Facebook post. “My heart is broken. Yesterday, Jennifer Bloom Guttenberg and I lost our baby girl to a violent shooting at her school. We lost our daughter and my son Jesse Guttenberg lost his sister. I am broken as I write this trying to figure out how my family gets through this. We appreciate all of the calls and messages and we apologize for not reacting to everyone individually. Jen and I will be figuring things out today and so we ask that you respect our privacy. We will be getting messages out later regarding visitation. Hugs to all and hold your children tight.” — Chris Hixon, 49 Hixon, the athletic director at the high school, was confirmed dead by family and friends Thursday.

Her family member, in a lengthy Facebook post, called her a “smart, kind hearted and thoughtful person.” “Though she was some what reserved, she had a relentless motivation towards her academic studies, and her soft warm demeanor brought the best out in all who knew her.

      "CBS Evening News CBSN Parkland school shooting: Teachers return to high school PARKLAND, Fla. -- Teachers and faculty returned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Friday, the first time they were back at the school since the Feb. 14 shooting that killed 17 and wounded 15 others. Broward County Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie said teachers returning to the school on Friday are doing their best to be strong. Runcie told reporters outside the Parkland school that he did not want to see teachers in his district carrying guns in the future. He said he was \"totally against arming teachers\" because \"they have a challenging job as it is.\" Authorities have said the armed school resource officer on campus did nothing to stop shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz. Runcie said he did not know why the officer failed to act, but there was nothing prohibiting him from entering the building where the shooting began. Runcie said students and teachers who do not want to ever return to the high school will be transferred to other schools in the county. The teachers returned to banners lining the fences and hallways with messages of support, CBS Miami reports. From schools to private businesses across the area, it seems that everyone wants to get their hands dirty to show that they stand with Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. In addition to the signs, supplies are being collected for those who are unable to return to their classrooms and are being relocated to whatever space is available. A sign made by the students at Pine Island Montessori school shows hundreds of hand prints made by the students under the hashtag #MSDStrong. The banner was made up of individual marks that, when put together, show a giant show of support for the returning students. \"We are hoping that, as they come back to school, they know the entire community is behind them,\" said Lacey Rogers, the marketing coordinator at the school. \"We are not in the immediate proximity but we are thinking of them.\" Kiss County 99.9 FM also wanted to help, but is giving the community a chance to write their own messages. There's a number of events hosted by the station this weekend, you will find giant vinyl sheets donated to the station by Testa & Sons Signs in which you can leave a message of support for the returning staff and students. \"To see the support that has come out with this is really amazing,\" said Fish, the morning host. \"We wanted to do this to see how much more support we can do because there is no limit.\" There's been no limit to the amount of support, since each individual mark will add to the growing message that everyone stands with Stoneman Douglas. Kiss County banners can be found this Saturday at the Panther's game and also at a Trisha Yearwood book signing at the William Sonoma on Miami Beach.\n",

      "Share: Stoneman Douglas student finds bullet hole in backpack while returning to school PARKLAND, FLA. (WSVN) - A student who returned to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Sunday for an orientation discovered that she was almost hit in the shooting that killed 17 of her classmates and teachers. “(The bullet) could have gone through my backpack, but I’m pretty sure it just grazed it or slightly passed it. The fact that my backpack was so close to me is really mind blowing,” said student Brooke Harrison. According to WPTV, Harrison retrieved her bag from the same classroom where three students were killed: Alyssa Alhadeff, Alex Schachter and Alaina Petty. “We know how lucky we are,” said Harrison’s mother, Denise. “From the stories we already heard in the classroom, we go pick up the backpack, we saw this. Everyday, we’re saying to ourselves, we’re so lucky.” Before she went back to class on Wednesday, Harrison voiced her thoughts on returning to campus. “It’s going to be sad because I’m going to remember the fact that three of my classmates won’t be able to go back to school and that three of them won’t be able to see their friends and see that everyone is OK,” she said. Harrison’s parents said while they weren’t worried about their daughter’s return to school, there is still a feeling of uncertainty. “One of the greater concerns that we have is, what happens next?” said Harrison’s father, Robert Harrison. “When the news cycle ended and six months have gone by, what actions will have been taken to ensure this doesn’t ever happen again — at this school or any other?” Harrison’s parents said they are no strangers to tragic events; they lived just two blocks away from the World Trade Center during the 9/11 attack.

All players and umpires will wear Stoneman Douglas caps before opening day games in honor of the victims. “It’s great what Major League Baseball is doing to show support for our community and our school,” Todd Fitz-Gerald said. “It’s been a rough week. Just being out here and having a sense of freedom today and be around the game that you love, the sport you grew up playing your whole life, and seeing what these guys are doing, we’re grateful.” “Words can’t really express what we’re going through, but this today is huge for us, for our school community.”\n",

      "Parkland Shooting Survivor Speaks Out When a gunman opened fire at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on Feb. 14, Anthony Borges blocked a door so his classmates could avoid the gunfire. (Published Wednesday, April 4, 2018) Hero Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School student Anthony Borges appeared at a news conference Friday where he called out Broward Sheriff Scott Israel and Broward Schools Superintendent Robert Runcie in a statement. Borges, who is still wheelchair-bound and didn't speak, had the statement read by his attorney, Alex Arreaza, at the news conference. The teen said he appreciated Israel and Runcie visiting him in the hospital but said they failed him and the other victims of the Feb. 14 shooting at the Parkland school. \"I want to say that both of you failed us, students, teachers and parents alike, on so many levels,\" Arreaza said while reading the statement. \"I am a 15-year-old that was shot five times while Broward Sheriff's deputies waited outside and decided that they weren't going to come in the building.\" Borges was released Wednesday morning from Broward Health Medical Center after nine surgeries. The teen is credited with saving the lives of 20 classmates by attempting to close and lock a classroom door during the shooting. His family has filed notice that they will sue authorities to seek money to cover the cost of his recovery. \"I understand it, they have an absolute right to do it, they've been through horrific tragedy, they're suffering enormous pain,\" Runcie said last month after learning the family was planning to sue. Borges said officials should have known that shooting suspect Nikolas Cruz was a threat. \"You knew he was a problem years ago and you did nothing. He should have never been in school with us,\" the statement read. Israel has said that his agency will fully cooperate with a Florida Department of Law Enforcement Investigation into the shooting. \"We will find the truth,\" Israel said last month. \"If the deputies did nothing wrong, then we move forward. If the deputies made mistakes, I’ll act accordingly and handle it appropriately.\" Borges thanked the community for their support and said he is still in mourning for the victims. \"I don't know why I survived and they didn't,\" he said. \"We have the responsibility to tell the world what happened here.\"\n",
